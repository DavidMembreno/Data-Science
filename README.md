Welcome to my data science portfolio, where I showcase a variety of projects from my coursework and independent work. In this repository, I explore real-world Kaggle datasets using techniques like data cleaning, feature engineering, data visualization, and machine learning model comparison. The projects include detailed Jupyter notebooks with step-by-step explanations, making them a great resource for anyone interested in data science and machine learning.

This repository will continue to grow with new projects, including those from other classes or independent research.

Project 1 (Data 215): Explored coffee reviews data, applying cleaning and transformation techniques to uncover valuable insights.

Project 2 (Data 215): Analyzed Steam video game reviews, applying feature engineering, model comparison, and supervised learning techniques.

Project 1 (Math 331): Investigated IMDb movie ratings, focusing on data wrangling, visualization, and predictive modeling.

Project 2 (Math 331): Analyzed coffee ratings, applying similar machine learning model evaluation and data preprocessing steps as in the previous project.

Project 2 (CSC 435 â€“ Machine Learning): Developed a YouTube comment toxicity detection pipeline using transformer models. Combined and cleaned multiple Kaggle datasets, benchmarked several models, and selected s-nlp/roberta_toxicity_classifier for final classification. Produced visualizations, statistical analyses, and a Streamlit application for real-time comment moderation.

Each dataset is sourced directly from Kaggle, offering real-world data for hands-on practice. This repository will keep evolving with new data science challenges, including both class projects and independent research.
